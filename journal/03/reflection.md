# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts


This week we learned about the mvc pattern. This was definetly a very difficult week. The hardest part was learning where your
code needs to go to make the file talk to each other correctly. It was a shock to learn that most devs work like this given that the original way we were doing it seemed easier. After tuesday i was able to get the hang of it and complrtr the labs for the days. I'd count the entire week as a victory because it was very difficult to learn the mvc pattern.
