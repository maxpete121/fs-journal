# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
The first two days of changing the dom went very well. On wednesday /i had a lot of trouble focussing so I felt
like I had fallen behind a bit. It would be a lie if I said I wasnt freaking out a bit. Then on thursday I chilled out
and everything for javascript just seemed to click. Something I'm still not great at is thinking of a good way to
style my page. I know the language and syntax but my brain seems to not have a design feature added to it because every design 
i make is: grey square, round the grey square. It looks like i might be more of a backend dev.
