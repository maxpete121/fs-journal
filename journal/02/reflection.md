# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
The first Two days of changing the dom were very easy for me
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
that javascript can change the html and draw it on the page
- What are you struggling with?
honestly now styling is a little harder. I feel good about javascript and the language for styling. I
seem to have issues thinking of a good look for the page that isn't grey and black everything.
- What would you count as a victory?
I was very worried about my javascript understanding on wednesday, but then by the lab on thursday everything just seemed to click in my head.

I'm feeling great about the course and I enjoy coding more than I expected to
