# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
Everything this week went pretty well. The api's are super simple to write and work on. The only issue I had during the week was how
tedius it is to write apis. It was cool to finally learn how to write the back end of an app because it opens up a lot of new possibilities but it is a bit repetative.
