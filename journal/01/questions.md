# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    > | To save website changes to a server that can be accessed by multiple people. |

02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
    > | It is used to create a new file directory |

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
    > | A class put on an object to change its look. |

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    > | A way to set the order in which your classes will be fired |

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    > | The order that your code runs in could get bugged due to too many objects trying to fire first |

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```

    > | Selector, block, and a value |

07. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
    > | Design can make a person trust or distrust a website. It can convey professionalism and a sense of safety |

08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?
    > | To get a better understanding of how you're going to build your site. |

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    > | Yes because having a plan saves you time as opposed to winging it. |

10. Define the display `:flex property:`
    > | This property displays the content in your element side by side instead of in a column |

11. What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
