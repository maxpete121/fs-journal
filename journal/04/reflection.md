# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
I'd say the whole week went well. After the mvc week, learning apis and how to connect them to forms seemed like way less of a
challenge. I struggled a bit with multiple apis and converting the data but i feel i have a good understanding now. The biggest shock this week for me was partner day. I finally understand that working with a partner makes you say what you have to do out loud which in the end helps both of us learn the content.
