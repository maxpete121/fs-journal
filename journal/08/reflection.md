# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
I had a good week. I learned its harder to work in groups than I thought. I have to get comfortable with letting other
people make decisions and trusting others to get the job done right. I do really enjoy working by ourselves and getting to make our own choices on our project.
